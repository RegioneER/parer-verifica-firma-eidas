| [CVE-2024-2961](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/17/9)|The iconv() function in the GNU C Library versions 2.39 and older may overflow the output buffer passed to it by up to 4 bytes when converting strings to the ISO-2022-CN-EXT character set, which may be used to crash an application or overwrite a neighbouring variable.|High|Upgrade glibc to 2.28-251.el8_10.1|
| [CVE-2024-33599](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3339)|nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cacheIf the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhaustedby client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup datamay result in a stack-based buffer overflow.  This flaw was introducedin glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.|High|Upgrade glibc to 2.28-251.el8_10.2|

| [CVE-2023-6597](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/20/5)|An issue was found in the CPython `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class affecting versions 3.12.1, 3.11.7, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.The tempfile.TemporaryDirectory class would dereference symlinks during cleanup of permissions-related errors. This means users which can run privileged programs are potentially able to modify permissions of files referenced by symlinks in some circumstances.|High|Upgrade platform-python to 3.6.8-62.el8_10|
