| [CVE-2024-2961](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/17/9)|The iconv() function in the GNU C Library versions 2.39 and older may overflow the output buffer passed to it by up to 4 bytes when converting strings to the ISO-2022-CN-EXT character set, which may be used to crash an application or overwrite a neighbouring variable.|High|Upgrade glibc to 2.28-251.el8_10.1|
| [CVE-2024-33599](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/22/5)|nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cacheIf the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhaustedby client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup datamay result in a stack-based buffer overflow.  This flaw was introducedin glibc 2.15 when the cache was added to nscd.This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.|High|Upgrade glibc to 2.28-251.el8_10.2|

| [CVE-2024-21147](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4573)|Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).  Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u411, 8u411-perf, 11.0.23, 17.0.11, 21.0.3, 22.0.1; Oracle GraalVM for JDK: 17.0.11, 21.0.3, 22.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.14 and  21.3.10. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition.  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as  unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.4 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts).  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).|High|Upgrade java-21-openjdk to 1:21.0.4.0.7-1.el8|
